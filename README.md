[Gitea](https://gitea.io) is a self-hosted git service written in Go. It provides a setup that is similar to [Github](https://github.com) but a solution that you host yourself. This repository contains the necessary configuration to run a full Gitea service in [Docker](https://docs.docker.com) using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose) with the capability to auto renew SSL certificates with [Let's Encrypt](https://www.letsencrypt.org).
